Compoents 
global: Header , NavBar , SideBar
notes...
if i want to provide an context api .... i should provide it ...to App.js not any smaller componets 
you can not use style attribute on componets

to read a local json file ....put the file inside the public folder 
then do the fetching


if the erroe was SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON ....
then the respone of the fetching is html or XML file XXXX
